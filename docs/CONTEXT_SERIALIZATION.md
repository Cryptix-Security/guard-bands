# Canonical Context Serialization

Guard Bands signs a canonical JSON payload. Every field that travels in the
markers is authenticated, so none of them can be tampered with or downgraded
without invalidating the MAC:

```json
{
  "alg": "GBv1-HMAC-SHA256",
  "content": "<exact wrapped content body>",
  "context": { "...": "..." },
  "exp": 1735689600,
  "iat": 1735688700,
  "iss": "<issuer / minting principal>",
  "kid": "<signing key id>",
  "nonce": "<guard-band nonce>",
  "v": "1"
}
```

The `alg` tag provides domain separation and blocks algorithm downgrade; `iat`
and `exp` bind the band's lifetime so freshness is enforced from authenticated
data (fail closed) rather than from an external ledger alone. Bands signed
with an Ed25519 key carry `"alg": "GBv1-Ed25519"`; the tag follows the
resolved key's type, so a band can never verify under a different algorithm
than the one it was signed with.

The canonical serializer uses:

- UTF-8 encoded JSON
- sorted object keys
- compact separators with no insignificant spaces
- unescaped non-ASCII characters
- no NaN or Infinity values

This makes context key order irrelevant:

```json
{"request_id":"req-001","user":"alice"}
```

and:

```json
{"user":"alice","request_id":"req-001"}
```

produce the same authenticated context.

## Context Design

Context should include the values that make a wrapped payload valid for exactly the intended use:

- `request_id` or workflow execution id
- `tenant_id` or account boundary
- authenticated user or service principal
- policy path or tool path
- model/workflow version when relevant
- timestamp or expiration bucket when using time-bounded replay protection

Do not include unstable values that legitimately change between wrap and verify unless they are intentionally part of the security decision.

## Compatibility Note

Changing canonicalization changes MAC input. If this POC is extended into a deployed system, treat serialization rules as versioned protocol behavior and include the serializer version in signed metadata before supporting multiple formats.

The current marker format includes protocol version `v:1`, issued/expiry
timestamps, and the minting issuer:

```text
⟪INERT:START:v:1:r:nonce:iat:1735688700:exp:1735689600⟫
content
⟪INERT:END:mac:signature:kid:key001:iss:b64url(issuer)⟫
```
