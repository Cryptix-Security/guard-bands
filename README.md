# Guard Bands

**Cryptographic boundaries that make untrusted LLM content inert by default**

## The Problem

Large Language Models process instructions and data through the same input channel, creating a fundamental security vulnerability. When user content (documents, emails, web pages) contains malicious instructions, LLMs may execute them as legitimate commands.

This is the same architectural flaw that plagued early computing systems until out-of-band signaling separated control from data.

## The Solution

**Guard Bands** wrap untrusted content with cryptographically signed boundaries:

```
âŸªINERT:START:r:b64(nonce):h:b64(hash)âŸ«
[Untrusted user content goes here]
âŸªINERT:END:mac:b64(mac):kid:keyidâŸ«
```

**Key Innovation**: The LLM cannot treat content as "safe data" unless it first calls a verification service that validates the cryptographic signatures. Invalid signatures mean the content should be treated as potentially malicious instructions.

## How It Works

1. **Wrapping**: Untrusted content gets wrapped with cryptographically signed markers
2. **Binding**: Signatures are tied to specific context (request ID, model, timestamp)
3. **Verification**: LLM must call verification service before treating content as inert
4. **Policy Enforcement**: Only validated content can be used for tool calls or sensitive operations

## Security Benefits

- **Prevents Forgery**: Attackers cannot create valid markers without signing keys
- **Context Binding**: Signatures prevent replay attacks across conversations  
- **Tamper Detection**: Any content modification invalidates the signature
- **Time Boxing**: Built-in expiration prevents stale attacks

## Implementation Advantages

- **No Model Changes**: Works with existing LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Incremental Deployment**: Apply selectively to high-risk content
- **Measurable Security**: Clear metrics on prevented injection attempts
- **Performance Conscious**: Crypto operations happen server-side

## Advanced Features

- **API-Level Isolation**: Mutual exclusion between data and instruction modes
- **Progressive Security**: Multiple security levels from basic to maximum
- **Forward Secrecy**: Optional progressive ratcheting for conversation-level protection
